Description:  Generalized factor model for ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types.
    We develop a two-step iterative procedure so that each update can be 
    carried out parallelly across all variables and samples. The fast 
    computation version is provided for ultra-high dimensional data,
    see examples for more details.
